### Overview
Food-Flow is a web-based platform designed to address the challenges of food waste and insecurity in Singapore, by facilitating the responsible redistribution of surplus food. It enables organizations to donate typically discarded excess food items to users in need for free, through listings and reservations.  

It is designed with users at its core, providing real-time notifications of food listings, efficient reservation management, and safeguarding the quality and safety of donated food items, through the employment of AWS cloud services and advanced technologies including browser-based federated learning and Apache Kafka. By leveraging a cloud-native and microservices-based infrastructure using Kubernetes and Docker, and robust data exchange through gRPC and web-sockets, Food-Flow provides a scalable and reliable system, ensuring accessibility and usability for a wide user base.  

Food-Flow is more than a platform; it is a step towards a world whereby every food item is valued and well-utilized. It is aimed at fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility amongst users, by empowering them to build a sustainable future together, one listing and reservation at a time. By connecting donors with users in need, Food-Flow promotes sustainable food practices and aims to reduce the impacts of food waste and insecurity in Singapore.  

### System Architecture
Food-Flow consists of 11 microservices that are orchestrated together using Docker, Kubernetes, and Web Sockets.
